The promises of AI, despite the concerns, will have overwhelmingly beneficial effects on the military.
The ability to help people from around the world will redefine humanitarian aid.
The ability to optimize soldier performance on the battlefield will change the way we wage war, putting fewer lives at risk.
Falling behind, even a little, can have a detrimental effect because AI has an exponential ability for improving.
Given the amount of uncertainty, itâ€™s possible that analysts will look back on the AI fad in jest.
However, given its scope as a technology and the amount of investment in AI, we are at the dawn of the age of artificial intelligence.
Artificial intelligence will redefine the methodologies and abilities of militaries around the world.
One can only hope that it brings us closer as a unified human race.
