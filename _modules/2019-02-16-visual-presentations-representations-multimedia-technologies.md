It is interesting that mind mapping has been listed as a very general approach to brainstorming or idea forming (Davies, 2011).
Mind mapping has been used quite a bit for drilling down into complex topics to resolve a point.
It can be used on as specific of a topic as is desired without feeling limited.
After reading through these articles, I’ve realized that I’ve been doing all three (mind, concept, and argument mapping) under the guise of mind mapping.
I just hadn’t been taught the formal structure of the others, so they all looked a lot like mind maps; lacking the business flow diagram equivalent of text in the lines (Stevenson, Hartmeyer, & Bentsen, 2017).

I find the formalized structure in brainstorming to be quite tedious and limiting.
A tool used to brainstorm should not require planning or thought to use.
You shouldn’t be thinking about whether you’re doing it right.
You should be focusing on the argument or idea that is in front of you.
Of course, will a little repetition, the techniques can be adopted and even a very young child can learn what should come next in the process (Haith, Hazan, & Goodman, 1988).

While using these tools, learners or brainstormers improving their own retention of the knowledge they are developing and researching; mapping dual encodes the knowledge and reduces cognitive load enabling more working memory to be devoted to learning (AEL, 2003).
This can also explain why many educators believe that gamification and immersive environments are a superior form of learning.
