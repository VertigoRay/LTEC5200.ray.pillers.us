title: Incorporating Technology in Teaching and Learning
---
I found it intriguing that Taylor (1980) had the wisdom to see the impact that computers would have on education.
It was so profound and confident that he introduced his book with the claim stating, "For the foreseeable future, computing will play an increasingly important role in human learning.
However, no one yet knows exactly how great that role will eventually be, or precisely what form it will finally take" (p.
241).
Growing up with technology, I know how fast these changes can be implemented, and how some technologies

There was an introduction to Internet of Things (IoT) this week as well.
I've seen a lot of examples that already exist and prove how IoT can improve our lives.
Thermostats, fire alarms, packages, shipping containers, and many more already use IoT to provide low-cost data collecting and sending solutions.
While they could create their own network (such as the Philips Hue Bridge) they still connect to the actual network/internet via WiFi or cable.
The other network just allows for communications over newer and low-energy use mediums, such as Bluetooth 4.0.
Most IoT devices are just data collectors.
Think of a smart motion sensor that's really nothing more than a motion sensor that can tell something on the internet that something moved; now, it's an IoT Smart Motion Sensor.
It could even be a door handle that notifies something that it has been turned, or what the current state of the locking mechanism is, such as locked or unlocked.
However, just because the doorknob is locked, it doesn't mean the door is closed.
You might also want a smart door hinge that reports the position, open or closed, it is in and measures the amount of force that was applied to open the door or how much heat was generated during the opening or closing process to determine if more lubrication is needed; now that's a smart hinge.
IoT is just smarter things that can communicate to something on the internet that's configured to listen for the data the thing wants to provide.
This was outlined very well by Gubbi, Marusic, Buyya, and Palaniswami (2013) when they tabled dozens of examples of low-energy consumption, low-data throughput devices that collect and send simple data about a specific area of interest (p.
1651).

As for incorporating IoT with technology, your imagination is your limit.
What about a pen that captures handwriting in grade schoolers and offers live critiques or some sort of stimuli (no, not an electric shock) to do write more legibly? What about a keyboard that hides the characters in a typing class, but reveals the next character needed after a teacher set duration of hesitation? What about just a smart moisture monitor that notifies when the class plants need more water?
