Raymond has developed a few complex IT systems here at UNT to help streamline and automate some mundane tasks.
I manage and support the technical of faculty and staff for [COS](//cos.unt.edu), [CLASS](//class.unt.edu), [SOJ](//journalism.unt.edu), and [CI](//ci.unt.edu) here at UNT.
I'm hoping to learn how new technologies have been adopted and successfully implemented in existing higher-ed classrooms.
